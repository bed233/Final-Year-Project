Hypatia - https://github.com/Divested-Mobile/Hypatia (Focuses on Scanning individual Files on Android and comparing hashes with a regularly pdated Signature Database based on ClamAV)
LibreAV - https://github.com/projectmatris/antimalwareapp (Focuses on Scanning Individual Apps on android and rating them based on Permissions and Intent)


Most likely going to implement both into my project as they both handle Anti malware in different ways that provide a tangible security benefit when working together to secure device.
