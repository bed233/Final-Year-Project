Found a couple of FOSS Anti-Malware for Android that I could potentially use for Malware Detection in my project. Currently (and over the next couple days) comparing the 2 apps to each other to see which one is better suited for my project and whether they both tackle Anti-Malware in different ways and if there is any benefit to implementing to finding a way to implement both into my project. For example, from my understanding, Hypatia focuses more on individual files on the device such as pictures whereas LibreAV focuses more on scanning the actual apps on the device. This means that theoretically, there is a security benefit to implementing both Open-Soruce malware scanners in my Security Suite. Currently am waiting on a response from the organizors as to how to correctly 'fork' the Open-Source Projects from Github to my Gitlab Repository.

Have Received guidance on how to implment Open Source Projects from Github into my Gitlab. 'forked' the 2 FOSS Anti-Malware for Android Applications into my gitlab and added them as a submodule of my main project folder. Added my supervisor and the organizers to both submodules to ensure everyone who needs access has access. Now that this has been completed, I am able to start looking through the FOSS apps and understand how they work and how I could adapt them to work in my security suite. I have now setup Android Studio and both apps in Android Studio and am able to run both sucessfully on a virtual android device running latest API of android. Now will go through each version of android to try and decide what is the earliest version of android I can work on whilst keeping everything compatible.

Have Tested both FOSS implementations for Malware Detection on multiple version of Android and determined that LibreAV will run on Android 4.1 and above with Hypatia running at Android 5 and above. Using these findings, I will be aiming to use Android 5 for the remainder of my project. This will ensure that I am able to support 98.8% of Android Devices according to Google API Version Distribution Chart.
