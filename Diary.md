Found a couple of FOSS Anti-Malware for Android that I could potentially use for Malware Detection in my project. Currently (and over the next couple days) comparing the 2 apps to each other to see which one is better suited for my project and whether they both tackle Anti-Malware in different ways and if there is any benefit to implementing to finding a way to implement both into my project. For example, from my understanding, Hypatia focuses more on individual files on the device such as pictures whereas LibreAV focuses more on scanning the actual apps on the device. This means that theoretically, there is a security benefit to implementing both Open-Soruce malware scanners in my Security Suite. Currently am waiting on a response from the organizors as to how to correctly 'fork' the Open-Source Projects from Github to my Gitlab Repository.
